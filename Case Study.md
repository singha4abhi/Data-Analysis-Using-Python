# CASE STUDY
# Client Background: 
The client is a leading service provider specializing in comprehensive inspection, audit, and testing services across various industries. 
Their inspection services span sectors such as textiles, food, and electronics. In testing, they cater to industries including footwear, textiles, toys, and food. Additionally, the company provides thorough audit services, with a focus on factory audits, ensuring compliance and quality across multiple business domains.".

# Challenges: 
Following are the challenges that the client was facing:

  1. The client faced ongoing issues with the Web app, as it provided insights that did not meet their specific business needs and lacked in-depth analysis capabilities.
  2.  Additionally, the app did not offer the functionality to export reports in PDF format, limiting their ability to share insights effectively. 
  3. Another challenge was the inability to track live data, as the client was required to manually aggregate data through their API. 
  4. The most significant issue involved Row-Level Security (RLS); the client needed to grant full access to admins, allowing them to access, download reports, and manage users, while limiting certain users to view-only access.
# Solution: 
To address these challenges, we developed a comprehensive reporting solution using Power BI: -
  1. This solution offers in-depth analysis and a flexible environment for end users to conduct analyses tailored to their specific needs. 
  2. It also resolved the issue of tracking live data, allowing for seamless, real-time insights. 
  3. The ability to easily export reports to PDF enables users to share reports with clients and stakeholders efficiently. 
  4. Additionally, the implementation of Row-Level Security (RLS) ensures secure access, allowing administrators full control while limiting other users to view-only access, thereby safeguarding sensitive data.
# Step-by-Step Process for Report Generation:
 **DATA FETCHING**
  1. The data was arriving in an aggregated format, so we developed a Python script to generate daily data for more granular analysis.
  2.  We analysed the data structure and created a Python script to streamline and organize the data.
  3.  Some chart data was missing, so we requested the client to provide dummy data. After analysing the provided data, we developed the corresponding reports.
  4.  The data structure for some charts differed, so we analysed the discrepancies and created a Python script to standardize the data.
  5.  we conducted thorough data validation to ensure accuracy and consistency throughout the process.


 **REPORT GENERATION**

  1.  We built the logic for the charts by transforming the aggregated data into a daily format.
  2.  We attempted to reduce the page length using bookmarks, but the client preferred to view all the information at once. This preference had not been discussed earlier.
  3.  we worked on finalizing the UI design and chart color formatting.
# Outcome: 
 1. The implementation of the comprehensive Power BI reporting solution resulted in several significant improvements for the client. The enhanced reporting capabilities provided in-depth, tailored analysis, allowing end users to easily explore and manipulate data to meet their specific business needs. Real-time insights became possible, enabling the client to track live data without manual aggregations, improving decision-making speed and accuracy.
 2. The ability to export reports in PDF format streamlined the sharing of insights with external clients and stakeholders, increasing efficiency in reporting workflows. Additionally, the incorporation of Row-Level Security (RLS) ensured secure access to sensitive data, giving administrators full control over user permissions. This not only safeguarded data but also improved user management by enabling full access for admins and restricted, view-only access for certain users.
 3.  Overall, the solution significantly improved operational efficiency, data security, and the client's ability to generate actionable insights, empowering them to make more informed, timely decisions.
